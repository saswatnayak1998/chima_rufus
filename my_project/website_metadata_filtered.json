        "content": "Back to blog The benefits of HIPAA compliance April 8, 2024 Overview According to the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR), there has been a considerable upward trend in healthcare data breaches since the office began tracking data breach statistics in 2009. Now more than ever, protecting patient data is paramount—and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is key to providing patients with security and privacy. HIPAA is a federal law passed in 1996 designed to protect patient health data. Covered entities, including healthcare providers, health insurance companies, healthcare clearinghouses, and any business associates of a covered entity that use or disclose protected health information (PHI), are required by law to comply with HIPAA. ‍ Breakdown of HIPAA There are three key parts of HIPAA—the Privacy Rule, the Security Rule, and the Breach Notification Rule. ‍ The HIPAA Privacy Rule ensures that PHI is protected throughout the flow of data by addressing when and how individual health information can be used or disclosed. During the process of providing and receiving quality healthcare, health data has to flow from one entity or individual to another. If you’ve been to the doctor recently, you can probably visualize this flow. The nurse tells the doctor about why you came in today, the doctor visits you and perhaps gives you a diagnosis and prescription, your doctor’s office sends your prescription information to a pharmacy, and your health insurance gets a summary of your visit in order to provide coverage. And with patient portals and apps, all of that data can be uploaded and available to you electronically, too. ‍ The HIPAA Security Rule requires all covered entities to ensure the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI; to detect and protect against security threats, impermissible uses, and disclosures; and to certify compliance within their workforce. ‍ Lastly, the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule requires covered entities and their business associates to provide notification when PHI is compromised as a result of a breach. ‍ Benefits of HIPAA compliance Compliance with HIPAA is often more than just a legal requirement for organizations—it’s a way to protect patient data, ensure the integrity of healthcare systems, and communicate to patients, partners, and stakeholders that the organization takes security seriously. ‍ Let’s take a closer look at some key benefits of HIPAA compliance: ‍ Avoid penalties HIPAA is more than just a compliance framework—it’s a federal law. Non-compliance with HIPAA regulations can lead to severe penalties. Organizations that fail to protect PHI may face hefty fines, reputational damage, and even criminal charges. By complying with HIPAA standards, organizations can ensure they operate legally and mitigate the potential risks of legal penalties. ‍ Build trust with patients and customers When companies adhere to HIPAA regulations, patients feel more secure in sharing their sensitive information. HIPAA was enacted in order to protect patient privacy, but it goes beyond just patient trust—complying with HIPAA can also build trust with partners and important stakeholders. This trust is foundational for both patient relationships and key business strategies. ‍ Mitigate risk HIPAA requires organizations to implement robust security measures to safeguard electronic PHI (ePHI). This includes encryption, access controls, regular audits, and comprehensive risk assessments. Some specific policies that should be put in place to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of PHI and ensure patient data is protected include those that establish procedures for safeguarding access to PHI, responding to HIPAA violations when they occur, and implementing HIPAA training for everyone who has access to PHI as part of their day-to-day roles. By following these processes, organizations strengthen their compliance postures, reduce the likelihood of data breaches, and mitigate potential threats to PHI. ‍ Streamline operations To comply with HIPAA, organizations are required to adopt streamlined processes and standardized procedures for managing PHI. This not only enhances security and privacy, but also can improve overall operational efficiency within organizations. ‍ Use security as a differentiator Lastly, organizations should use security as a differentiator to enhance their reputation and give them a competitive edge. HIPAA compliance can demonstrate that your organization takes security, privacy, and compliance seriously, differentiating your business. A key step to proactively build trust with stakeholders is to undergo a security or privacy audit performed by an independent third party like BARR Advisory , which can be made easier with a compliance automation solution like Delve . These measures provide stakeholders with valuable information about the controls that are in place at an organization and any gaps that may increase the risk of unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive information. ‍ Conclusion Given the state of healthcare-related data breaches, HIPAA compliance is no longer merely a regulatory requirement—it’s a fundamental business practice. HIPAA should be used as a foundation, and organizations should build upon with security assessments like ISO 27001, SOC 2, or HITRUST.  By safeguarding patient privacy, mitigating risk, and streamlining business operations, organizations that comply with HIPAA can strengthen the foundation of security and privacy in the healthcare industry and beyond.

        "content": "Back to blog The 2-minute guide to HIPAA compliance February 28, 2024 Almost all companies that process health data in the US need to become HIPAA compliant. Here’s the 2-minute breakdown of what HIPAA is, how to get compliant, and key tips and tricks. ‍ What is HIPAA? The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) outlines how sensitive protected health information (PHI) should be handled in the US. ‍ HIPAA applies to you if: You deal with health information AND you work with another healthcare organization (i.e. hospital, clinic, digital health platform, etc. known as a “covered entity”) ‍ Exceptions: You use de-identified health information (that doesn’t contain any names, emails, ID numbers, or other data outlined in HIPAA’s Safe Harbor method) OR Your service is for consumer users ONLY and you don’t work with healthcare organizations (in which case getting compliant is highly encouraged but not required) ‍ Consequences of not being HIPAA compliant: If you get caught for not complying, you could face serious consequences: ‍ You could get fined (up to $1.5M/year) You could be personally liable (criminally punishable) You could lose your business license ‍ HIPAA is enforced by the Oﬃce for Civil Rights (OCR) of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also enforces good security practices and can prosecute companies that don’t have them in place. ‍ Pros and cons of being HIPAA compliant ‍ Pros Ability to process PHI It’s a selling point Enhanced credibility + trust Improved data security ‍ Cons Time + monetary cost Additional security overhead Restrictions on services that can be used ‍ What’s required for HIPAA compliance? To get HIPAA compliant, you must ensure that you are covered on both a technical and administrative level. On a high level, here are the requirements for compliance: ‍ Technical: Configure infrastructure that follows 2 core principles: Least privilege access → encryption in transit and at rest, Identity and Access Management (IAM) role/access restriction, firewalls, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), public and private subnets, Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), etc. High availability → load balancing, autoscaling, multi-availability zone/multi-region deployment, read replicas, blue green deployment, and rollbacks ‍ Implement logging System access logs → record who accesses the system with timestamps and outcome User activity tracking → log specific actions performed by users, including interactions with sensitive data Security and errors → log security incidents and errors in detail ‍ Monitor your infrastructure Automated alerts → have a system in place that warns you when an adversary is attempting a breach Health monitoring → maintain a dashboard to keep track of systems and ensure availability Review security → regularly verify data integrity, roll keys, and update with patches ‍ Administrative: Implement legal policies ~20 required security and privacy policies Sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with all 3rd party vendors (e.g. AWS, OpenAI, Supabase, Twilio, etc.) ‍ Establish company protocols for questions like: Who can access what data? What happens if an employee leaves? Who responds if there is a data breach? ‍ Continually manage and assess compliance Regularly conduct checks → risk assessments, vendor security reviews, and compliance trainings Stay on top of tasks → many small details like multi-factor authentication, using a GitHub Org, screen lock, IAM access controls, etc. ‍ What compliance solutions are available? Instead of doing things from scratch (very risky, expensive, & time-consuming), check out the solutions below: ‍ ‍ For technical tasks: Aptible, Porter, etc. Will help you deploy HIPAA-compliant infrastructure Total time: < 5 days ‍ For administrative tasks: Vanta, Drata, Secureframe, Sprinto, etc. Will provide the non-technical tasks (i.e. legal policies, task checklist) Will run checks on your infrastructure setup but won’t fix it Total time: 3-4 weeks ‍ For BOTH technical & administrative tasks: Delve Will deploy HIPAA-compliant infrastructure for you Will provide a monitoring/logging dashboard Will provide streamlined non-technical tasks (legal policies, task checklist, etc.) Total time: < 2 days ‍ Key tips & tricks for HIPAA compliance Start early: Getting HIPAA compliant becomes harder the later you do it (shift left approach). Building compliant from day 1 is much easier. Plus, you need to be compliant before you can process PHI anyway. Use a compliance solution: Unless you’re a lawyer or healthcare security expert, HIPAA compliance isn’t something you can easily DIY. Choose a pre-existing solution to ensure you don’t make mistakes. Choose services carefully: If you’re HIPAA compliant, you can only use HIPAA compliant services that offer BAAs (for example, you can’t use Heroku or OpenAI APIs until you sign a BAA).

        "content": "Back to blog Who Does HIPAA Apply To? February 20, 2024 If you handle protected health information in any capacity, you need to be aware of HIPAA regulations since failure to comply can lead to federal investigations or fines. Follow this decision tree to assess whether you need to become HIPAA compliant or not. ‍ Who Needs HIPAA Compliance? ‍ ‍ Step 1: Determine if you are a Covered Entity. A Covered Entity is a healthcare provider, health plan, or a healthcare clearinghouse that handles medical information which can identify an individual, called protected health information (PHI), as defined under HIPAA law (§160.103). Examples include hospitals, pharmacies, digital clinics, doctors' offices, health insurance companies, and medical billing services. ‍ Are you a healthcare provider, health plan, or healthcare clearinghouse? If Yes: You need to be HIPAA compliant. If No: Proceed to Step 2. ‍ Step 2: Determine if you are a Business Associate. A Business Associate is a vendor or subcontractor who handles PHI on behalf of a Covered Entity or on behalf of another Business Associate, as defined under HIPAA law (§160.103). Examples of Business Associates include AI medical scribes, cloud service providers, data processing companies for clinical trials, AI phone call agents, and electronic health record system providers. ‍ Do you handle PHI on behalf of Covered Entities or another Business Associate? If Yes: Proceed to Step 3. If No: You are exempt from HIPAA. ‍ Step 3: Determine if you handle PHI. If you handle PHI that can identify a patient, you need to become HIPAA compliant. However, if the PHI does not contain any of the 18 identifiers below, which are defined by HIPAA’s Safe Harbor provision (§164.502(d), §164.514(a)-(b)), and the information still cannot be used to trace back to the individual it belongs to, then you are exempt from HIPAA regulations. ‍ 18 identifiers defined by the Safe Harbor provision: Names All geographic subdivisions smaller than a state, including street address, city, county, precinct, ZIP code, and their equivalent geocodes All elements of dates (except year) for dates that are directly related to an individual, including birth date, admission date, discharge date, death date, and all ages over 89 and all elements of dates (including year) indicative of such age, except that such ages and elements may be aggregated into a single category of age 90 or older Telephone numbers Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers Fax numbers Device identifiers and serial numbers Email addresses URLs SSNs IP addresses Medical record numbers Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints Health plan beneficiary numbers Full-face photographs and any comparable images Account numbers Any other unique identifying number, characteristic, or code Certificate/license numbers ‍ Do you collect, store, or transmit PHI that isn’t de-identified according to the Safe Harbor provision? If Yes: You need to be HIPAA compliant. If No: You are exempt from HIPAA. ‍ Which of the following scenarios requires HIPAA compliance? ‍ AI Phone Calling Agents Yes, you need to be HIPAA compliant. An AI phone calling service that assists healthcare providers in scheduling appointments, providing patient reminders, and communicating health-related information would need to become HIPAA compliant because it handles PHI during these phone calls and is used at hospitals and clinics (Covered Entities). ‍ AI Medical Scribe Yes, you need to be HIPAA compliant. An AI medical scribe that assists healthcare professionals in transcribing and documenting patient visits should be HIPAA compliant as it processes PHI to generate medical notes and is used by providers, clinicians, and hospital workers (Covered Entities). ‍ Therapy Practice You might need to be HIPAA compliant. Because many therapists do not accept insurance payments or conduct certain forms of electronic transactions, they might not be Covered Entities and hence might not be subject to HIPAA regulations. However, those that do accept insurance need to comply with HIPAA. Additionally, some therapists still choose to adopt HIPAA compliant practices because of the sensitive nature of information discussed during therapy sessions. ‍ Smart Watch No, you don’t need to be HIPAA compliant. A fitness app or wearable that tracks workouts, dietary habits, or overall health metrics (such as Fitbit or Apple Watch) does not need to be HIPAA compliant. The data captured and analyzed by these apps, including steps, calories burned, or sleep patterns, falls outside the jurisdiction of HIPAA protections, as these apps are typically consumer-facing and are not run by healthcare providers or clinics (Covered Entities). ‍ Conclusion Prioritizing HIPAA compliance is vital in the healthcare industry to uphold data security standards and maintain trust with clients. HIPAA regulations apply to (1) Covered Entities, which are healthcare providers, plans, and clearinghouses, and (2) Business Associates, which process PHI on behalf of Covered Entities or other Business Associates.

        "content": "Back to blog Expert interview: HIPAA compliance for SaaS companies March 21, 2024 The United States takes a very sectoral approach to data privacy regulations, which can often lead to confusion on what is expected for a SaaS company when they are handling personal information. When it comes to personal health information, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) has set the standard for data privacy going back more than 25 years. ‍ We sat down with HIPAA expert, Nick Accomando, to get his perspective on navigating some of the core aspects of HIPAA. ‍ Tell us about your background as a HIPAA expert. I have been working as a lawyer in the healthcare space for about 17 years now and have been focused on data privacy issues for the vast majority of it. Prior to my current role as the Chief Compliance & Privacy Officer at Flatiron Health, I held global roles at GSK, IQVIA, and IBM Watson Health, where my work was focused at the intersection of data, technology, AI, and privacy in the healthcare space. My expertise is focused in digital innovation, de-identification methodologies, and transformative technologies in Big Data . ‍ What is HIPAA in its simplest sense? I find the US approach to data privacy so interesting because pretty much the rest of the world takes one approach to data privacy and the US takes a very different approach. Pretty much everywhere else in the world has an overarching privacy law that breaks down personal information into different categories (e.g., basic, sensitive, pseudonymous) and then lays out the privacy and security requirements based on the type of personal information you are handling, regardless of where it came from. ‍ Here in the US, HIPAA actually regulates entities first and then sets expectations for how they handle certain types of information. At its core, HIPAA regulates covered entities and business associates, and sets the privacy and security expectations for how those entities handle protected health information (“PHI”). So, when you are trying to determine if HIPAA applies to your handling of personal information, you should always start with two questions: 1) Am I acting as a covered entity or business associate; and 2) am I processing protected health information? If the answer to both those questions is yes, then you are operating within the scope of HIPAA. ‍ How can I determine if I’m a Covered Entity or a Business Associate under HIPAA? While there is some nuance around the transmission of electronic patient health information and billing, covered entities generally fall into 3 buckets under HIPAA: 1) health plans (e.g., health insurance companies), 2) healthcare clearinghouses (e.g., transmitters of medical claims data); and 3) health care providers. I will say that healthcare providers are broadly defined and include hospitals, doctor’s offices, nursing homes, pharmacies, and laboratories. ‍ A business associate is a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information on behalf of, or provides services to, a covered entity. As a general rule of thumb, if a covered entity is contracting you to perform a service and that service means you are accessing protected health information belonging to the covered entity, then there is a very strong chance you are acting as a business associate. ‍ You can find in-depth information about covered entities and business associates in this useful blog post . The US Dept. of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the US Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”) also provide free resources for navigating these questions. I would say I refer to the HHS’s HIPAA FAQs for professionals almost daily. ‍ Are you saying not all sensitive personal health information in the US is protected by HIPAA? I am – in fact, I’d say that there are a lot of everyday situations where HIPAA does not apply to the processing of sensitive personal health information. For instance, business-to-consumer health and wellness apps that directly collect a consumer's personal health information are largely outside the scope of HIPAA. When you download a health and wellness app on your phone for personal use and enter your health information into it, there is a really good chance that information is not protected under the requirements of HIPAA. ‍ Another example where the processing of sensitive personal health information is largely outside the scope of HIPAA is clinical research. Regulated clinical trials certainly have their own set of applicable regulations to consider around privacy and data integrity, but they largely fall outside the scope of HIPAA. ‍ What do you see as the biggest consequences for not being HIPAA compliant? I want to start by saying that when HIPAA applies to you, complying is not optional, it is a requirement and failure to comply can lead to corrective action, including financial penalties. Since the compliance date of the Privacy Rule in April 2003, OCR has received over 351,372 HIPAA complaints and has initiated over 1,183 compliance reviews. To date, OCR settled or imposed a civil money penalty in 142 cases resulting in a total dollar amount of $142,448,772.00. ‍ In addition, there is very real reputational harm that comes with failure to meet HIPAA requirements when providing tools and services in the healthcare spaces. Covered entities like health insurance companies and hospital systems take HIPAA very seriously and will not be willing to work with companies that don’t take HIPAA just as seriously. ‍ To note: HIPAA is enforced by the Oﬃce for Civil Rights (OCR) of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also enforces good security practices and can prosecute companies that don’t have them in place. ‍ Can you outline what getting HIPAA compliant looks like for SaaS companies? Once a SaaS company decides it’s in scope for HIPAA compliance, they should generally start with a risk assessment, which is required under HIPAA. Once the risk assessment is complete, implementation is where I see smaller companies get tripped up the most because there is a ton of information to process, decisions to be made, and infrastructure to build out. ‍ When it comes to SaaS, I’d say the biggest challenge is ensuring adequate technical controls within the cloud infrastructure. The large cloud providers like AWS, GCP, and Azure offer HIPAA-eligible cloud infrastructure, but it is largely on the user to configure it appropriately before they can call themselves HIPAA-compliant. Figuring out this configuration can be really challenging and takes weeks to months of work. ‍ The other area I would call out is the administrative controls, which include all the requisite privacy and security policies that must be implemented and followed. Building out these policies can be incredibly time-consuming and requires subject matter expertise to address the content. ‍ Can Delve help companies with HIPAA compliance? The Delve platform has really impressed me. I think it offers very real solutions to the challenges associated with building out technical infrastructure and policy development. It also couples those solutions with real-time security insights and monitoring. ‍ Any final thoughts? I think it is clear that HIPAA compliance can be really challenging and we have only hit on a few key areas today. When I think about HIPAA compliance, it is all about arming yourself with the right tool box to proactively address HIPAA requirements. Delve certainly seems like a tool I’d want in my tool box. ‍ Disclaimer This interview was conducted with Nick Accomando in his independent capacity as a HIPAA expert and he is not a paid employee or consultant of Delve.

        "content": "Back to all case studies How Bland Unlocked $500,000+ ARR in 1 Week with Delve $500,000 ARR unlocked 7 days to audit-ready 68 hours saved Isaiah Granet CEO, Bland AI \"Delve unlocked $500,000 of contracts for us in 1 week — all under the intense rigor of intense enterprise security.\" The problem Not being SOC 2 compliant was blocking $500,000 of urgent enterprise contracts for Bland Bland, a leader in AI-driven phone call solutions, was on the cusp of securing multiple high-value contracts. However, these contracts first required Bland to be SOC 2 compliant — and on a short timeline. Although Bland had already purchased a compliance solution, their current platform was too cumbersome, not customized to their company’s needs, and involved steep manual effort from the team. They knew they had a lot on the line and didn’t have the confidence that their current compliance platform would be able to get them compliant in time to win these valuable deals. ‍ Instead, Bland needed a compliance solution that would let them move quickly and get compliant in a streamlined manner. The team didn’t want to waste time working through an overengineered platform, but rather wanted an intuitive and lean solution that maximized every hour spent on compliance. Moreover, the engineering team needed to remain focused on growth rather than compliance, making a high-effort solution unviable. ‍ At the same time, Bland needed a platform that could provide comprehensive security to meet the requirements of its enterprise prospects. “At our scale, this requires a very solid SOC 2 program,” says Isaiah Granet, CEO of Bland. A simple checkbox compliance package wasn’t going to be sufficient. Unfortunately, most platforms that did provide effective compliance and security seemed to do it at the cost of time and money. Bland needed something that could achieve all. ‍ Thus, Bland decided to take a step back and see if there was a better option. The Solution Delve’s AI-automated platform helped Bland implement a comprehensive SOC 2 program to meet the compliance rigors of its large enterprises Bland’s decision to work with Delve was a simple one. ‍ Delve’s platform offered a customized, fast-track compliance solution that allowed Bland to achieve SOC 2 Type I certification in just a matter of days. To achieve SOC 2 Type I certification, a company must first prepare to undergo an official audit and then undergo that audit. Usually, the audit preparation process takes weeks to months of manual to-dos and long documents. Delve’s platform made the audit preparation process incredibly straightforward and Bland was able to complete it in just a matter of days. ‍ “The platform integrates directly with our infrastructure and has live monitoring of our compliance status which gives us peace of mind,” says COO Sobhan Nejad. Delve’s automated scanning and monitoring let Bland integrate their technical tools with the Delve platform and clearly see what was in compliance and what wasn’t. Fixing compliance errors was also incredibly easy with custom instructions and AI automation that already knew the ins and outs of Bland’s technical setup, ensuring all compliance requirements were met. ‍ Delve’s platform felt “like TurboTax for compliance,” reducing the manual workload for Bland's team and allowing them to focus on core tasks instead of compliance.
